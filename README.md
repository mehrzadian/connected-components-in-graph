ðŸ¤ž More Description:

ðŸŽ„Tree{
    A tree is an undirected graph G that satisfies any of the following equivalent conditions:
      âœ”G is connected and acyclic (contains no cycles).
      âœ”G is acyclic, and a simple cycle is formed if any edge is added to G.
      âœ”G is connected, but would become disconnected if any single edge is removed from G.
      âœ”G is connected and the 3-vertex complete graph K3 is not a minor of G.
      âœ”Any two vertices in G can be connected by a unique simple path.
    If G has finitely many vertices, say n of them, then the above statements are also equivalent to any of the following conditions:
      âœ”G is connected and has n âˆ’ 1 edges.
      âœ”G is connected, and every subgraph of G includes at least one vertex with zero or one incident edges. (That is, G is connected and 1-degenerate.)
      âœ”G has no simple cycles and has n âˆ’ 1 edges

ðŸ§µDepth First Search Algorithm {
    A standard DFS implementation puts each vertex of the graph into one of two categories:
        1.Visited
        2.Not Visited
    The purpose of the algorithm is to mark each vertex as visited while avoiding cycles.

    The DFS algorithm works as follows:

        1.Start by putting any one of the graph's vertices on top of a stack.
        2.Take the top item of the stack and add it to the visited list.
        3.Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. Add the ones which aren't in the visited list to the top of the stack.
        Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until the stack is empty.
